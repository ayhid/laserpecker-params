# 🎯 LaserPecker Parameters

A simple tool to easily find and visualize LaserPecker LX1 laser cutting and engraving parameters.

## 📝 About

This project is a personal initiative created by a hobbyist and is not affiliated with or endorsed by the LaserPecker brand.

I created this tool because I found myself constantly referring to the official parameter tables, which weren't particularly user-friendly. The format provided on the official website, while comprehensive, wasn't easily readable during my projects.

- 🎚️ Different laser modes (10W, 2W, 20W)
